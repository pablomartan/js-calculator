# Javascript Calculator
A simple javascript calculator. Project for FCC FEnd Dev Libraries.

## Usage
You can try it in the link that's on the project's description.
To modify it you'll have to clone this
repo by running the following command on your terminal `git clone
https://github.com/pablomartan/js-calculator`. Once cloned, you'll have to
enter the directory it was cloned to and run `npm i` to install the node
dependencies (Webpack, Babel, React, Redux and several loaders). After it is
done, you can run `npm start` to start a hot reloading server, which will run
the webapp on port 3000 of your local host. Now you can modify any of the files
in `src/` and as you save the changes, the app will automatically reload.
To get a static working site, you can run `npm run build` and webpack will
compile and place the necessary files on `dist/`. You can then open the html
file, or upload it anywhere you like, respecting the terms of the GPL License
(see below).
